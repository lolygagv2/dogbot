# TreatBot Project Summary

## What We're Building

TreatBot is an autonomous, AI-powered dog training robot that combines computer vision, edge AI inference, and behavioral psychology to revolutionize pet training. Unlike existing treat dispensers that operate on simple timers or remote controls, TreatBot actively observes, understands, and responds to dog behaviors in real-time, creating a true automated training companion.

## Core Functionality

The robot uses a Raspberry Pi 5 with a Hailo-8 AI accelerator to run sophisticated neural networks directly on the device. A three-stage AI pipeline processes video in real-time: first detecting dogs in the frame, then analyzing their pose through 24 keypoints, and finally classifying behaviors like sitting, lying down, or spinning. When desired behaviors are detected with sufficient confidence, the system triggers a reward sequence combining audio praise, LED celebrations, and automated treat dispensing.

The physical platform features motorized wheels for navigation, allowing TreatBot to patrol homes autonomously or follow predetermined routes. A pan-tilt camera system tracks dogs as they move, maintaining visual lock even as pets circle the robot. The treat dispenser uses a rotating carousel mechanism that advances one compartment at a time, ensuring controlled portion delivery. RGB LED rings provide visual feedback, while a DFPlayer Pro module delivers high-quality audio cues and praise.

## Unique Differentiators

What sets TreatBot apart is its genuine understanding of dog behavior rather than simple motion detection. The system recognizes individual dogs through a combination of visual features and optional ArUco marker collars, maintaining separate training histories and progress reports for multi-dog households. The behavior detection goes beyond basic poses - it understands context, duration, and consistency, implementing proper variable-ratio reinforcement schedules that professional trainers recommend.

The robot operates completely offline, requiring no cloud services or subscriptions. All AI inference happens locally on the Hailo chip, ensuring privacy and eliminating latency. The modular architecture allows third-party developers to add new behaviors, training programs, or integrate with smart home systems through an open API.

## Current Development Status

The core components are individually functional. The AI detection pipeline successfully identifies dogs and classifies five distinct behaviors with high accuracy. The treat dispenser mechanism reliably delivers single portions. Hardware controllers for motors, servos, audio, and LEDs all work independently. The camera system can switch between multiple modes optimized for different scenarios.

However, these components aren't yet unified into a cohesive product. Multiple versions of the main orchestrator exist, reflecting iterative development but lacking a definitive architecture. The celebration sequence combining lights, sounds, and treats remains unconnected. The mission system that should coordinate training sessions exists only as a framework.

## Vision and Impact

TreatBot represents the convergence of robotics, AI, and animal behavior science. By automating positive reinforcement training with scientific precision, it addresses the consistency problem that defeats most pet training efforts. The robot never forgets to reward, never loses patience, and never reinforces the wrong behavior. For busy families, elderly pet owners, or professional trainers managing multiple dogs, TreatBot offers a breakthrough in maintaining training consistency.

The ultimate goal extends beyond simple treat dispensing to become a comprehensive pet care platform. Future capabilities include health monitoring through gait analysis, separation anxiety mitigation through scheduled interaction, and even multi-robot coordination for large properties or commercial facilities. TreatBot aims to strengthen the human-pet bond by ensuring pets are well-trained, mentally stimulated, and properly rewarded, even when their humans are away.
