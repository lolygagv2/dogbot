# Resume Chat Context - TreatBot Session Log

## Session: 2025-10-22 [Latest]
**Goal:** Complete unified TreatBot architecture with manual control & GUI integration
**Status:** ✅ Complete - Unified architecture with manual control and GUI ready

### Work Completed:
- **IMPLEMENTED**: Complete 6-phase unified TreatBot architecture following detailed plan
- **ADDED**: Manual remote control service (RC car style) with motor service wrapper
- **INTEGRATED**: Existing working GUI (live_gui_detection_with_modes.py) into unified system
- **CREATED**: Web-based remote control interface with touch controls
- **BUILT**: API endpoints for manual control (/manual/drive, /manual/keyboard, etc.)
- **UNIFIED**: Single main orchestrator (main_treatbot.py) as THE definitive entry point

### Architecture Phases Completed:
1. **✅ Phase 1**: Core Infrastructure (event bus, state manager, store, safety)
2. **✅ Phase 2**: Service Layer (detector, pantilt, motor, dispenser, sfx, led)
3. **✅ Phase 3**: Orchestration Layer (sequences, rewards, mode FSM)
4. **✅ Phase 4**: Configuration Files (YAML sequences, JSON missions, policies)
5. **✅ Phase 5**: Main Orchestrator (unified entry point)
6. **✅ Phase 6**: API Layer (FastAPI REST endpoints, requirements.txt)

### Key Solutions:
- **Manual Control**: Wraps existing motor controllers (core/hardware + motor_led_camera_control)
- **GUI Integration**: Preserves working live_gui_detection_with_modes.py functionality
- **Multiple Control Options**: Desktop (WASD), Web interface, API calls
- **Event-Driven**: Publish/subscribe pattern connects all components
- **Safety**: Emergency stops, auto-stop timers, battery/temperature monitoring

### Files Created:
- `services/motion/motor.py` - Manual control service (RC car style)
- `services/ui/gui.py` - GUI service wrapper for existing working GUI
- `manual_control.py` - Desktop manual control interface
- `web_remote_control.html` - Beautiful web-based remote control
- `test_manual_control_integration.py` - Integration tests
- Updated `api/server.py` - Added manual control REST endpoints
- Updated `main_treatbot.py` - Integrated motor service into orchestrator

### Manual Control Options:
1. **Desktop + GUI**: `python3 manual_control.py` (WASD + live camera)
2. **Web Remote**: Serve `web_remote_control.html` (mobile-friendly)
3. **API Direct**: REST calls to `/manual/drive` endpoints

### Critical Integration Features:

## Previous Session: 2025-10-21 11:00-12:15 UTC
**Goal:** Test treat dispenser and project refactoring planning
**Status:** ✅ Complete - Servo working, refactor plan established

### Work Completed:
- **TESTED**: Treat dispenser servo - confirmed working perfectly
- **CREATED**: Treat loader mode for even distribution while loading
- **DOCUMENTED**: Complete project structure analysis
- **IDENTIFIED**: Major architecture problems (3+ main files, scattered tests)
- **DELIVERED**: 500-word project summary and file structure documentation

### Key Findings:
- **Servo Status**: Carousel servo working - rotates one compartment at a time
- **Architecture Issue**: Multiple orchestrator files (main.py, dogbot_main.py, treat_dispenser_robot.py)
- **Components Status**: All hardware controllers working individually
- **Integration Gap**: Components not wired together into cohesive system
- **LED/Audio**: Celebration sequences exist but not connected to rewards

### Files Created:
- `test_treat_servo.py` - Interactive servo test menu
- `test_treat_servo_auto.py` - Automated servo test sequence
- `dispense_treat.py` - Simple treat dispensing utility
- `treat_loader.py` - Carousel loading assistant
- `PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md` - Complete file structure documentation
- `PROJECT_SUMMARY.md` - 500-word project description

### Critical Issues Identified:
1. **Multiple Main Files**: Need ONE definitive orchestrator
2. **Scattered Tests**: 30+ debug files in root directory
3. **No Clear Architecture**: Mission/API/Core relationships undefined
4. **Working But Disconnected**: Components work individually but not integrated

### Next Session Priorities:
1. **REFACTOR**: Create single definitive architecture
2. **ORGANIZE**: Move all test files to proper directories
3. **INTEGRATE**: Wire together celebration sequence (LED+Audio+Treat)
4. **UNIFY**: Create one main orchestrator to rule them all

### User Insights:
- Frustrated with repeated rewrites of main orchestrator
- Wants explicit project structure outside .claude folder
- Needs clear architectural hierarchy (API serves missions, etc.)
- All hardware confirmed working, just needs proper integration

## Previous Session: 2025-10-21 00:54-02:15 UTC
**Goal:** Debug treat dispensing failure and prepare for ArUco multi-dog tracking
**Status:** ✅ Complete - Treat dispensing fixed, foundation stable

### Work Completed:
- **FIXED**: Treat dispensing system - corrected hardware misunderstanding
- **CLARIFIED**: Only 3 servos exist (carousel, pan, pitch) - no launcher servo
- **APPLIED**: Exact calibration values (pulse=1700μs, duration=80ms per treat)
- **CONFIRMED**: Core system stability for ArUco multi-dog tracking development

### Key Solutions:
- **Hardware documentation**: Updated .claude/hardware_specs.md with correct 3-servo setup
- **Code fixes**: Changed treat dispensing from activate_launcher() to rotate_carousel(1)
- **Calibration**: Applied user-provided exact timing for single treat dispensing
- **Architecture assessment**: Confirmed stable foundation for additive ArUco features

### Files Modified:
- `.claude/hardware_specs.md` - Corrected hardware specifications
- `servo_control_module.py` - Fixed carousel rotation method, removed launcher code
- `live_mission_training.py` - Updated treat dispensing to use carousel

### Critical Discovery:
- No "launcher" servo exists - carousel handles all treat dispensing
- Core AI detection, camera, and mission systems are stable and ready
- Foundation is solid for multi-dog ArUco tracking without core rewrites

### Test Results:
```
✅ AI detection system working (clean logging)
✅ Mission training protocol functional
✅ Treat dispensing calibrated and ready
✅ Audio rewards working
✅ Hardware documentation accurate
✅ Core architecture stable for expansion
```

### Next Session Priorities:
1. **ArUco multi-dog tracking** - foundation confirmed stable
2. Core systems (AI, camera, missions) require no more foundational changes
3. Ready for pure additive development

### Commit: 4a42a1b5 - fix: Correct treat dispensing system - use carousel rotation not launcher

## Session: 2025-10-20 03:42-03:47 UTC
**Goal:** Debug AI detection failure and fix mission training system
**Status:** ✅ Complete - Detection system working correctly

### Work Completed:
- **FIXED**: Removed incorrect 90° camera rotation that was mistakenly added to AI controller
- **DEBUGGED**: AI detection "failure" - system was actually working correctly (0 dogs detected = no dogs in view)
- **VERIFIED**: AI3StageControllerFixed is working properly with `dogdetector_14.hef` + `dogpose_14.hef`
- **CONFIRMED**: Mission training system is ready for live use
- **CREATED**: Debug and test scripts to verify system functionality

### Key Solutions:
- **21,504 detection issue**: User was running wrong script (`run_pi_1024_fixed.py` vs correct `AI3StageControllerFixed`)
- **Camera rotation**: Removed erroneous 90° rotation - camera should be mounted correctly, no software rotation needed
- **Detection validation**: Created test scripts to prove system works correctly
- **Mission integration**: Confirmed live mission training system uses correct AI pipeline

### Files Created:
- `test_fixed_ai.py` - Test script for AI3StageControllerFixed
- `test_mission_with_controls.py` - Mission test with camera controls
- `debug_camera_view.py` - Camera view debugging script
- `show_ai_models.py` - Model configuration verification

### Files Modified:
- `core/ai_controller_3stage_fixed.py` - Removed incorrect rotation, added debug output

### Critical Discovery:
- The AI detection system was NEVER broken
- Logs showing `shape=(0, 5)` mean "0 dogs detected" (correct behavior when no dogs present)
- Previous logs with 21,504 detections were from wrong script with broken parsing
- Current system: ~19ms inference, clean output, servo controls working

### Test Results:
```
✅ AI system ready (AI3StageControllerFixed)
✅ Camera ready (1920x1080, no rotation)
✅ Servo controls ready
✅ Detection working: shape=(0, 5) = no dogs in view
✅ Inference: ~19ms (fast and efficient)
✅ Models: dogdetector_14.hef + dogpose_14.hef loaded correctly
```

### Next Session Priorities:
1. **Position dog in camera view** - system ready for live testing
2. Test live mission training with actual dog detection
3. Verify treat dispensing and audio commands
4. Fine-tune detection thresholds if needed

### Important Notes/Warnings:
- **Use correct scripts**: `test_mission_with_controls.py` or `live_mission_training.py`
- **DON'T use**: `run_pi_1024_fixed.py` (has broken detection parsing)
- **Camera mount**: Ensure physical camera orientation is correct (no software rotation needed)
- **Detection ready**: System will detect dogs when they're actually in view

### Files Ready for Production:
- `live_mission_training.py` - Full mission system with training protocol
- `core/ai_controller_3stage_fixed.py` - Working AI detection
- `missions/configs/sit_training.yaml` - Training protocol config
- Mission API fully functional with database logging

## Previous Session: 2025-10-19 02:30
**Goal:** Fine-tune behavior classification thresholds
**Status:** ✅ Complete
**Duration:** 45 minutes

### Work Completed This Session:
- Analyzed pose detection logs showing good confidence (0.619-0.725)
- Fixed "lie" vs "sit" misclassification issue
- Lowered "lie" detection threshold from y_ratio > 0.80 to > 0.72
- Added dual criteria for "lie": both y_ratio AND limb_spread
- Narrowed "sit" range from 0.50-0.75 to 0.45-0.68 for better precision
- Discussed continual learning approach: static model + feedback system

### Key Technical Solutions:
- **Lie Detection Fix**: `y_ratio=0.747, limb_spread=16.2` now correctly classifies as "lie" instead of "sit"
- **Dual Criteria Logic**: Combined position (y_ratio) and compactness (limb_spread) for more accurate classification
- **Threshold Refinement**: More precise ranges prevent behavior misclassification

### Files Modified:
- `core/ai_controller_3stage_fixed.py` (behavior classification thresholds updated)

### Test Results:
- ✅ User confirmed "works much better" for lie detection
- ✅ Classification logic now more accurate across all behaviors
- ✅ System maintains temporal smoothing and cooldown features

### Next Session Priorities:
1. Test full behavior range: spin, cross behaviors
2. Hardware integration: treat dispenser + reward system
3. Optional: Add simple feedback correction system
4. Multi-dog testing if needed

### Continual Learning Discussion:
- Recommended phased approach: Start static, add feedback later
- Simple correction buttons in GUI for gradual improvement
- Avoid full online learning due to hardware constraints
- Focus on manual threshold tuning first, then collect feedback data

## Previous Session: 2025-10-19 01:30
**Goal:** Fix behavior detection and GUI pose classification
**Status:** ✅ Complete
**Duration:** 2 hours

### Work Completed This Session:
- Fixed "unhashable type: 'slice'" error in pose classification
- Debugged pose detection confidence thresholds (lowered from 0.5 to 0.3)
- Improved behavior classification logic to bias toward "stand" over "sit"/"lie"
- Added temporal smoothing with 40% consensus requirement (4/10 frames)
- Implemented proper cooldown system (3 seconds between same behavior)
- Enhanced debug output for pose analysis and behavior detection

### Key Technical Solutions:
- **Pose Detection Fix**: Lowered confidence threshold from 50% to 30% to capture more poses
- **Array Slicing Bug**: Fixed boolean masking error causing "unhashable type: 'slice'"
- **Behavior Bias**: Reconfigured thresholds to default to "stand" instead of over-detecting "sit"
- **Temporal Filtering**: Changed from 60% consecutive frames to 40% non-consecutive for realism
- **WASD Controls**: Fixed inverted camera movement directions

### Files Modified:
- `core/ai_controller_3stage_fixed.py` (major behavior detection improvements)
- `live_gui_detection.py` (WASD control fixes, display smoothing)

### Test Results:
- ✅ Pose detection working (confidence range 0.275-0.725)
- ✅ Behavior classification working (`🎯 BEHAVIOR DETECTED: SIT (confidence: 5/5)`)
- ✅ WASD camera controls now move in correct directions
- ✅ No more "Initializing" screen flashing
- ✅ Cooldown system preventing behavior spam

### Next Session Priorities:
1. Test full behavior range: stand, sit, lie, spin, cross
2. Fine-tune y_ratio thresholds based on real dog testing
3. Verify behavior recording and treat dispensing integration
4. Test with multiple dogs if needed

**Git Status:** 771 uncommitted changes (mostly deleted patched_wheel files, plus modified hailort.log and main.py)

**Key Files Created Recently (last 2 days):**
- `core/ai_controller_3stage_fixed.py` - Fixed 3-stage AI pipeline using HEF direct API
- `live_gui_detection.py` - Real-time GUI with HDMI output (1920×1080)
- Multiple debug scripts for detection testing

### Current AI System Status:

#### ✅ WORKING: 3-Stage Detection Pipeline
- **Core System**: `core/ai_controller_3stage_fixed.py` - FULLY FUNCTIONAL
- **Test Script**: `test_3stage_fixed.py` - Confirmed working well
- **Models**: `dogdetector_14.hef` (4.3MB), `dogpose_14.hef` (18.8MB)
- **Performance**: Detection working correctly with HEF direct API
- **False detection bug**: ALREADY FIXED in previous session
- **Note**: The log snippet user provided was OLD (dated Oct 11, before fixes)

#### ✅ FIXED: GUI System (`live_gui_detection.py`)
- **Issue Was**: OpenCV compiled without GUI support (no GTK/display backend)
- **Fix Applied**: Added GUI availability check pattern from previous working versions
- **Headless Mode**: Now saves detection frames to `detection_results/` directory
- **Status**: Working - Creates detection images with overlays, stats, and behavior analysis
- **File Size**: ~427KB per frame (1920x1080 with detection graphics)

### Important Notes for Next Session:

#### Session Commands Fixed
- **How to start**: Ask Claude to "run session start protocol" (not `/project:session-start`)
- **How to end**: Ask Claude to "run session end protocol" (not `/project:session-end`)
- **Slash commands**: Don't work automatically - they're documentation files, not registered commands

#### Recent Commit History
```
4d0c075a Add real-time GUI for live dog detection with HDMI display
5f7be8f3 Fix 3-stage AI pipeline - detection, pose, and behavior analysis working
a4cad3e0 Reorganize test files into structured subdirectories
```

#### Critical Context Clarification
- **User Log Confusion**: The 21,504 false detections log was from Oct 11 (BEFORE the fix)
- **Current Status**: Detection is ALREADY FIXED and working correctly
- **Working Test**: `test_3stage_fixed.py` confirms the pipeline works
- **GUI Issue**: New problem - OpenCV lacks display support, needs headless mode
- **Camera Rotation**: User mentioned needs 90° CCW rotation (needs verification)

### Files Modified This Session:
- `.claude/commands/session_start.md` - Added chat history review
- `.claude/commands/session_end.md` - Added comprehensive history preservation

3. **Mission System**: Implement reward logic and training sequences
4. **Video Streaming**: Eventually add phone app streaming (user requirement)
5. **Hardware Testing**: Verify camera rotation (0° should be correct)

### Important Warnings/Reminders:
- **Large uncommitted changes**: 771 files need review before committing
- **Session commands**: Use verbal requests, not slash commands
- **Detection system**: Working but may need parameter fine-tuning for specific environments
- **Hardware orientation**: Camera is correctly oriented at 0° rotation
