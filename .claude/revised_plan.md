Section A: New Must Have Features and Additions (Ideas and Concepts)

Strategic Answers
A. Must-have features to lead field
•	Robust AI pose + audio fusion with reward logic
•	Return-to-dock charging and autonomous missions
•	Multi-dog ID and behavior history logging
o	– We’re going to put in a Happy Pet Progress Report, grading on a 1-5 bone scale. Talking about how many times the dog did something correct, and how many treats were issued, versus how many barks occurred. We already have the code for measured barks and recording from a microphone from Arduino code we wrote prior, we can just simply port that over or use it independently.
•	App with real-time AI view  + treat history + voice commands
o	We’re going to make sure there is both a photography camera mode that allows high quality photos (with automatic AI presets and saving/sending to dogs owner etc)
o	AI dog-detection mode which shows via Boxing and pattern recognition what behaviors the dog is doing in real time.
•	We will initialize a sound + behavior behavioral analysis module as well that combines the audio and pattern recognition with a synopsis on how the dog is possibly behaving.
B. High-value differentiators
•	Real autonomous training sequences (“Sit 5 times today → reward schedule”)
- Allows user to input a schedule for obedience training, like “instruct the dog to sit up to 5 times a day to get a treat. The treat will be issued randomly for 3/5 of the sitting achievements. So the dog will not get 100% reward but will learn to train 100% obedience.
•	Integrated photo/video AI curation for social sharing. User can help share or we will use default/most popular pet profiles to create a library of their automatic behavior.
•	Offline LLM mode (local commands without internet). There will be a pre-set library 
o	We need to identify which LLM we can integrate or use offline with ease.
•	Open API for third-party extensions (trainers, IoT integration)
o	All of this we are developing will need to be accessible via an API for third party integration, you could even pay someone to watch your dog over the internet in theory.
C. Competitive positioning
•	Focus on precision AI (vision + sound fusion via Hailo + IMX500) → far beyond toy treat dispensers.
•	Use premium materials and safety-certified power electronics → Dyson-level trust but dog-centric.
D. IR sensor guidance
•	Mount two IR receivers angled ±15° rear-facing.
•	Base dock emits pulsed IR (beacon pattern e.g., 38 kHz modulation).
•	Use signal strength differential to center robot while reversing.
•	Add cliff sensors to prevent edge drop while approaching.
•	Combine with wheel encoder timing for short-range navigation.
E. The killer combo that no one else has:
1.	True AI-powered autonomous training (not just scheduled treat dispensing)
2.	Individual dog recognition without collars (pose + ArUco backup)
3.	Real-time pose detection with adaptive learning (gets smarter over time)
4.	Social media auto-posting (viral marketing built-in)
5.	Multi-dog household support (most competitors fail here)
1.	– Ensure we can build profiles based on the dog being surveyed. 
F. Maximum Value Differentiators - What sets you apart from Furbo/Petcube/Treat&Train:
•	Active mobile trainer vs static camera
•	Hailo-8 edge AI (26 TOPS) vs cloud-dependent or no AI
•	Behavioral pattern recognition vs simple motion detection
•	Autonomous operation vs human-triggered only
•	Training program library vs one-trick devices
Your unique moat: Combining mobility + edge AI + behavioral training in ONE device.
G. Addressing "It's Already Been Done"
Competitor	What They Do	What They're Missing
Furbo/Petcube	Camera + treat toss	No mobility, no training AI
Anki Vector	Cute robot	No dog training, discontinued
Treat&Train	Stationary trainer	No mobility, no AI, manual only
Robot vacuums	Mobility + sensors	No pet interaction purpose
Your positioning: "First autonomous AI dog trainer that moves, learns, and trains multiple dogs independently"
H. Market Gap Positioning
Most AI pet robots today (Sony Aibo, Tombot, or Joy for All) simulate companionship, but none train and respond to real pets dynamically. The TreatBot’s hybrid vision-audio reinforcement loop fills that niche—AI companion for animals, not just for humans.

 
Section B: Technical and Development Roadmap

1.	Core AI and Detection
a.	YOLO8s inference for dog behavior, activity, and pose detection.
b.	Refine and evaluate pose keypoints for behavior differentiation (sitting, lying, still, playing).
c.	Establish API endpoints for get_behavior() and send_behavior_event().

2.	Camera + Servo Integration
a.	Implement pose-based drive/camera tracking modes (pan/tilt servo synchronization).
b.	Add PID control for smooth tracking and target locking with IMX500 vision feed.
c.	Required Modes and Functionality:

  i.	Photography Mode
   1.	Enable max camera resolution and manual photo/video adjustment (ISO, exposure, etc.).
   2.	Disable AI inference completely while in this mode—no YOLO runs, no tiling, no post-processing.
   3.	Direct video or image stream to app or storage.
   4.	Entry trigger: manual user/app selection.

  d.	AI Detection Mode
   i.	Activate real-time YOLO inference at 640x640 input size.
   ii.	Stream AI-annotated video (bounding boxes/results) and/or plain video to remote app.
   iii.	No tiling—single frame analysis per cycle for highest FPS possible.
   iv.	Entry trigger: manual toggle OR auto-switch when vehicle is in motion (detected via DC motor sensors, IMU, etc.).

  e.	Vigilant Mode
   i.	Allow camera to operate at max resolution (2K or 4K), automatically tile the full frame into non-overlapping 640x640 crops.
   ii.	Run YOLO inference on each tile, merge results for whole-frame bounding boxes and detections.
   iii.	Designed for stationary/observation periods ("parking mode"), can be triggered automatically (vehicle stopped) or manually.
   iv.	Optionally, do not stream high-res video, only AI detections and summary to app to save bandwidth.

  f.	Autonomous Mode Switching:
   i.	Integrate sensor/event triggers to automatically shift between modes:
   ii.	If the motor is running/driving: AI Detection Mode.
   iii.	If stationary: switch to Vigilant Mode.
   iv.	Manual override/app input always takes precedence.
   v.	Buffer last few frames on mode switch for smooth transition.
   vi.	Only run one camera/AI pipeline at any moment—no concurrent modes to minimize bandwidth and CPU load.
 g.	Pipeline/Programming Suggestions:
   i.	Use GStreamer or OpenCV pipelines for video input conditioning.
   ii.	Set up a control script/service that manages mode switching based on sensor input (GPIO, motor status, etc.) and user remote control.
   iii.	The YOLO model is invoked via Hailo8’s SDK from either single-frame (AI Detection Mode) or tiled crops (Vigilant Mode).
   iv.	All mode/status transitions should be clearly reported/logged to the app interface for user feedback.

3.	Mission System API
a.	Modular mission structure with unified API layer.
Example: /missions/start, /missions/stop, /missions/log_behavior.
b.	Missions include Training, Reward Cycle, Return-to-Base, and Social Capture.

flash_leds()
delay_random(3,6)
b.	Maintain configurable schedules via YAML/JSON for routine automation.

b.	Optional Bluetooth mode override (HC-05 or BLE gamepad for exhibitions or demos).

9.	Audio Intelligence
a.	Microphone input via PyAudio + bark detection (FFT amplitude or ML bark classifier).
b.	Combined logic for “Quiet” behavior:
detected pose == “sit” + no bark amplitude > threshold → issue treat.

a.	REST + WebSocket API for all hardware actions and AI modules.
b.	Modules: motor, ai_pose, mission, audio, dock, battery, social.
c.	Unified pub/sub channel for telemetry broadcast (e.g., MQTT optional layer).

a.	Tune YOLO detection thresholds and filtering to avoid false treats.
b.	Add configurable behavioral logic tables via .yaml in /missions/config/.
c.	Training Mode: log poses, confirm correct behaviors, refine detection accuracy incrementally.
